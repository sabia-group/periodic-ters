  Updating Kohn-Sham eigenvalues and eigenvectors using ELSI and the ELPA eigensolver.

  Obtaining occupation numbers and electronic chemical potential using ELSI.
  | Note that, for insulating systems, the printed 'chemical potential' value is not uniquely defined.
  | It can be anywhere in the energy gap, as long as it correctly separates occupied and unoccupied states.
  | In systems with a gap, the physically relevant chemical potential is the VBM or HOMO.

  | Chemical potential (Fermi level):    -5.60207833 eV

  The gap value is rather small. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is most likely metallic (in the sense that there are states
  at or near the Fermi level). A DOS and/or band structure plot is required
  for an unambiguous distinction.

  This system has fractional occupation numbers. Since we use a finite k-point grid,
  this material is metallic within the approximate finite broadening function (occupation_type)
  applied to determine the occupation numbers. We conclude: there is no gap in this system.

  Final output of selected total energy values:

  The following output summarizes some interesting total energy values
  at the end of a run (AFTER all relaxation, molecular dynamics, etc.).

  | Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation      :      -37507669.180410385 eV
  | Final zero-broadening corrected energy (caution - metals only) :      -37507669.187427811 eV
  | For reference only, the value of 1 Hartree used in FHI-aims is :             27.211384500 eV
  | For reference only, the overall average (free atom contribution
  | + realspace contribution) of the electrostatic potential after
  | s.c.f. convergence is                                          :             -1.834792711 eV

  Before relying on these values, please be sure to understand exactly which
  total energy value is referred to by a given number. Different objects may
  all carry the same name 'total energy'. Definitions:

  Total energy of the DFT / Hartree-Fock s.c.f. calculation:
  | Note that this energy does not include ANY quantities calculated after the
  | s.c.f. cycle, in particular not ANY RPA, MP2, etc. many-body perturbation terms.

  Final zero-broadening corrected energy:
  | For metallic systems only, a broadening of the occupation numbers at the Fermi
  | level can be extrapolated back to zero broadening by an electron-gas inspired
  | formula. For all systems that are not real metals, this value can be
  | meaningless and should be avoided.

Warnings summary:

At least    1 warnings were raised during execution.
** WARNING:
 * A warning was issued further up regarding the accuracy of onsite integrals.
   An integral with a negative eigenvalue was among the flagged integrals.
   In most standard situations, this warning is probably harmless.
   If needed, this can be verified by adjusting the radial_multiplier flag.
** END OF WARNING
** WARNING:
 * A warning was issued further up regarding the speed of the s.c.f. convergence.
   One or more s.c.f. cycles took more than 50 s.c.f. iterations.
   It might be worth adjusting your convergence settings. For example,
   metals need a larger broadening and a smaller "charge_mix_param" value than semiconduct
ors.
