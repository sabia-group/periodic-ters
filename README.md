# Periodic TERS
This repository contains code and data related to tip-enhanced Raman spectra simulations using embedding near fields in periodic boundary conditions in FHI-aims.
The original numerical near field framework was introduced in 

Litman et al.: First-Principles Simulations of Tip Enhanced Raman Scattering Reveal Active Role of Substrate on High-Resolution Images. *J. Phys. Chem. Lett.* 14(30), **2023**.

The finite-field periodic framework is introduced in (upcoming)

Brezina et al.: Explaining Principles of Tip-Enhanced Raman Images from Fully Ab Initio Modeling. *(in preparation)* xxx, **2025**.
